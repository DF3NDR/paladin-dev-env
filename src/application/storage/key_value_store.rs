Key Value Store

A key value store is a simple storage mechanism that stores keys and values in a simple key value
pair. This is a simple storage mechanism that can be used to store and retrieve data in a simple
and efficient manner.

This key value store is a simple in-memory store that stores keys and values in a HashMap. This
store is not persistent and will lose all data when the application is restarted.

This store is used for use cases where a temporary storage mechanism is needed, such as caching
'values' that need to be repeatedly accessed.
