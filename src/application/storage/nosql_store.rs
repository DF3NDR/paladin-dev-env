/*
NoSql Database Application Repository

An application repository is an port that defines the operations that the application layer can perform on the data layer (infrastrucure repositories) and the interface requirements that the data layers adapter must implement. The application repository is implemented by the data layer, which contains the actual implementation of the operations defined in the application repository. The application repository acts as a bridge between the application layer and the data layer, allowing the application layer to interact with the data layer without having to know the details of the data layer implementation.
