Notification Container Module

Notification Type is an extension of teh Message Type used for the Notification system.
Notifications are used to inform users or systems about events, updates, or alerts.
It includes details such as the notification type, message, and associated metadata.

Some examples of notifications include:
- User notifications (e.g., new message, friend request)
- System alerts (e.g., service down, configuration change)
- Application updates (e.g., new version available, feature release)
- Task reminders (e.g., upcoming deadlines, scheduled events)
- Security alerts (e.g., unauthorized access, suspicious activity)
- Content updates (e.g., new content published, content approval)
- Workflow notifications (e.g., task completion, approval needed)
- Custom application events (e.g., user achievements, milestones reached)
- Error or warning messages (e.g., system errors, validation failures)
- General announcements (e.g., system maintenance, policy changes)
- User activity notifications (e.g., login, logout, profile updates)
- Event reminders (e.g., calendar events, scheduled meetings)

These notifications can be used to keep users informed, alert them to important changes, or 
prompt them to take action.

The Notifications are sent by using specific types of application level Notification Services, which are built
on the core platform application service which is further built as an extension of the more
generalized core base level Message Service.
