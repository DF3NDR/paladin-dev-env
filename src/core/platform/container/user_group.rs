/*
User Group

A `User Group` is a collection of users that share a common Element.

The Group Element that unites the group is a shared reference that can be defined
in the application. A Group could be either ad-hoc or implicit based on a shared Element.

This creates a type of View that can be used to filter and sort users based on the
shared Element.

 A User Group Element is a generic that is
any type of element.  

Example:
A User_Group node has a UUID and a name.  A User Type can be definied on the Application
level to have a User Group Element.  The User Group Element can be a Tag, a Role, a 
Department, a Team, or any other type of Element that can be shared by a group of users.
